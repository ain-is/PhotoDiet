# GettingStarted: Install 

## Installation 

Installation is now smooth and clean thanks to our new install assistant. It is self-explanatory, with tips and hints helping you know what to do if anything fails. 

## How do I start? 

1.  First, download Pixelpost (there is a download link on our home page) 
2.  Second, create a database in your MySQL administration (if you don't have one already).  
    ***Tip:* Usually you find your MySQL administration in** www.yourdomain.com/mysqladmin or in
    **www.yourdomain.com/phpmyadmin**. Contact your web host if you need help creating a database. 
3.  Third, unzip the Pixelpost package and upload it to your server. You can place it into the domain 
    root as well as any folder of your choice. 
4.  Open your browser and go to the following address:  
    **www.example.com/(photoblog_foldername)/admin/install.php** 
5.  Follow the instructions provided on screen and enjoy photoblogging with Pixelpost!
