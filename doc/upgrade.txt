# GettingStarted: Upgrade 

## Upgrade 

Upgrading to the latest version of Pixelpost is now smooth and easy with the new install assistant. It is self-explanatory and is done within one minute.  
It works with all Pixelpost installations, no matter which version you are using. 

Thanks to our team member Dave for all of his great work on this! (Sorry, but this must be said) 


## How do I Upgrade? 

1.  First, make a backup of your actual Pixelpost installation: 
    *   download all the files on your server and store them in a cool and dry place. 
    *   go into your MySQL Administration, locate your Pixelpost tables and find the button "export".  
        
2.  Download Pixelpost by clicking on the "Download" link located on our home page. 
3.  Unzip the Pixelpost package and upload it to your server. 
    *   **Don't delete the old Pixelpost files, just overwrite them.** 
    *   Make sure that the file pixelpost.php is still within the includes folder and the correct database login is there. 
    *   **Open the addons folder and delete the following Addon files in the root addons folder:** 
        *   admin_akismet_comment.php 
        *   front_akismet_comment.php  
            **(they moved to the addons/_akismet folder where they must not be deleted!)** 
        *   referer_spam.php  
            (this isn't used anymore) 
4.  Open your browser and go to the following address:  
    **www.yourdomain.com/(photoblog_foldername)/admin/install.php**  
    ***Tip:* If you see the "Installation" screen instead of the "Upgrade" screen, the configuration file** pixelpost.php may have been damaged or removed. Get it from your files backup, check the database login and re-upload it into the "includes" folder. 

5.  Follow the instructions provided on screen and enjoy photoblogging with Pixelpost!
