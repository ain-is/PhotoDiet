Datetime addon version 1.1
================================================================

Provided as a basic example.
It retreives the current datetime as reported by the server.

The new tag to use in templates are
<CURRENT_DATE_TIME>
which will be replaced with the variable $current_date_time.

It's very simplistic.

When creating an addon, please always have the $addon_* variables.
Those are displayed in a users admin panel under general info.

All variables from the main script are available here, be sure not to overwrite!

$tpl holds the current template (image_template.html or comments_template.html etc).

 <b>Tag: </b>&lt;CURRENT_DATE_TIME&gt;";
